Trackit is a simple plugin that allows the user to add multiple tracking codes(Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, JSON schema markup, CSS Javascript) to the Header or Footer of WordPress.

== Description ==
Do you need to add Google Analytics or Facebook pixel tracking code to your website? TrackIt will simply take care of that for you!
Trackit is a simple plugin that allows the user to add a tracking code, CSS, Javascript, JSON markup, & ... to anywhere(Header or Footer) in  WordPress. Trackit is very simple and straightforward. Trackit allows the user to have multiple tracking codes at the same time.

= Simple to use =
We designed TrackIt to be simple and straightforward. You just add your tracking code and it will appear on your website. As simple as that. It just works!

= Developed by professionals =
There is a huge difference between a plugin that has been developed by a rookie and plugin that has been developed by a professional team of developers. Our code is clean. We maintain our plugin to adapt to the latest version of Wordpress. Our plugin doesn't put any overhead on your website.

= Manage multiple tracking codes =
Trackit allows you to add many tracking codes individually. This will eliminate the risk of error during removal of one tracking codes in future. Other competitor plugins keep all tracking codes in one place which makes it hard to distinguish the beginning and end of each snippet for removal in future.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/trackit` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Under Plugin menu click on "Track it" to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where should I add my Google Analytics tracking code?  =

Based on [Google official recommendation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/), Google Analytics tracking code needs to be added to the website header.  

= Where should I add my Facebook Pixel tracking code? =

Facebook Pixel should be added between <body> and </body> tags. Therefore, use the footer for adding Facebook pixel tracking code.

= Where should I add JSON schema markup? =

We recommend that you add JSON schema markup to the footer. This will increase the load speed of your above the fold content and leads to a better user experience.
